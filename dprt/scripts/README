History:

Originally there was the GRB WCS script. It is still (March 2010) in use.

That was heavily reworked into pipe_astrometric.csh by RJS and became the standard WCS 
fitting on archive. This may be found in /space/home/dev/src/OPS/Scripts/ARCHIVE/. It is
now obsolete. 

pipe_astrometric.csh diverged into two version. RJS maintained one copy on archive and
CJM developed an ICS and Solaris compatible version which was used by FRODOSpec on site
for acquisition.

CJM's and RJS's versions were remerged in late 2009 to create a single wcs_fit which runs
on both sites. That master script is here.

Note that the two sites are rather different and this script therefore can behave very differently
depending on circumstances. On archive it makes heavy use of on-line public data archives
(CDS, GSC etc) whereas on datared it cannot see the internet and uses local copies of 
USNOB and 2MASS PSC. Therefore there are varisou external helper applications (e.g., aclinet)
which are never actually used in a datared deployment whereas usnob would never be used in an
archive deployment.


Requirements
------------

/home/dev/tmp/wcs or /icc/tmp/wcs
/mnt/usnob1 should contain local copy of usnob1

MYBIN 		= /usr/local/bin/wcs/

sextractor:
${MYBIN}sex

our own:
${MYBIN}astrom_pipe.sex
${MYBIN}iterstat
${MYBIN}/get_local_usnob.csh , this calls:
${MYBIN}rd.awk and 
${MYBIN}usnob1
${MYBIN}/tostartab_hhmmss.sh 
${MYBIN}crop_usnob
${MYBIN}fits_modify_comment_static
${MYBIN}fits_get_keyword_value
${MYBIN}fits_add_keyword_value_comment_static

wcstools:
${MYBIN}imwcs
${MYBIN}fixpix
${MYBIN}gethead
${MYBIN}sethead

 basic:
/bin/awk
/bin/sed
/bin/echo
/usr/bin/test (NB /bin/test is the default under Solaris, but does not exist under Linux. /usr/bin exists under both.)
/usr/bin/wc  (NB /bin/wc is the default under Solaris, but does not exist under Linux. /usr/bin exists under both.)
/usr/bin/dc  (NB /bin/dc is the default under Solaris, but does not exist under Linux. /usr/bin exists under both.)
/usr/bin/bc  (NB /bin/bc is the default under Solaris, but does not exist under Linux. /usr/bin exists under both.)
/usr/bin/tail (NB /bin/tail is the default under Solaris, but does not exist under Linux. /usr/bin exists under both.)
/usr/bin/cut
/usr/bin/head
/bin/mv
/bin/cp
/bin/touch
/bin/cat
/bin/grep

My version also now uses:
/bin/chmod
/bin/rm
