We are using a Solaris compiled sextractor : eng@ltccd4:~eng/sextractor-2.5.0
GRB pipeline uses /home/dev/am_pipe_develop/sextractor-2.3.2/src.

Standalone compilation produces error:

*ERROR*: can't read astrom_pipe.param

Error is generated in catout.c when PARAMETERS_NAME file can't be found


astrom_pipe.sec has :
PARAMETERS_NAME	astrom_pipe.param  #name of the file for catalog contents

/home/dev/am_pipe_develop/sextractor-2.3.2/src/catout.c replaces reading of PARAMETERS_NAME with a hardcoded list:

   "NUMBER",
   "X_IMAGE",
   "Y_IMAGE",
   "FLUX_ISOCOR",
   "FLUXERR_ISOCOR",
   "BACKGROUND",
   "MAG_BEST",
   "MAGERR_BEST",
   "ELONGATION",
   "THETA_IMAGE",
   "FWHM_IMAGE",
   "FLAGS"
